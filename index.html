        "The old Romans had a custom which survived even into my life time. They
        would add to the opening words of a letter:"if you are well, it is well;
        I also am well. "Persons like ourselves would do well to say:"If you are
        studying philosophy, it is well. "For this is just what "being well"
        means. Without it the mind is sickly, and the body, too, though it may
        be very powerful, is strong only as that of a madman or lunatic is
        strong"
